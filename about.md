I had been dizzy, with bouts of severe vertigo over the past two years. The latest tests came back that it is something in my brain, possibly a brain tumor.

I've known intimately that life is short. But as I faced my own mortality I realized there were some things I wanted my kids to hear from me.

Some things I hope they remember.

I want them to read these messages as they get older. This is my attempt to preserve whatever words of wisdom I have to impart.
