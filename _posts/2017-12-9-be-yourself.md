I love the essay "Self Reliance" by Ralph Waldo Emerson.

> “Be yourself; no base imitator of another, but your best self. There is something which you can do better than another. Listen to the inward voice and bravely obey that. Do the things at which you are great, not what you were never made for.”

Be yourself.

Speak your honest thoughts.

> There is a time in every man's [and woman's] education when [they] arrive at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that [they] must take [themselves] for better, for worse as [their] portion.

Envy is ignorance.

Don't try to be like anyone else. Be yourself.

I love how the essay begins:

> I read the other day some verses written by an eminent painter which
were original and not conventional. The soul always hears an admonition
in such lines, let the subject be what it may.

When people are authentic and honest and open it is a breath of fresh air. No matter what it is you do, don't imitate. Be yourself.

There never has been another human being on this earth exactly like you and there never will be. Ever. Be you. Do all you can to hone and improve your skills, knowledge, and abilities.

> Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string.

If you haven't already, you should [read the essay](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~doyle/docs/self/self.pdf).
