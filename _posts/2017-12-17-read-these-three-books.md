As a voracious reader if you were to ask me what my favorite book is I couldn't answer. It's an impossible question for me. But I can tell you the books that have changed who I am more than any others. 

These books have changed my life. They changed the way I see the world. And they have made me into a better person. 

These are some of the few books that I continue to read over and over because each time I learn, improve, and become a better version of myself. Each time. 

Mans Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl
Big Magic by Elizabeth Gilbert
The Compound Effect by Darren Hardy

Each book is so different. 

Mans Search for Meaning touches me deeply and always brings a profound gratitude for the life I have. It also reminds me of the power of my mind and thoughts. It has shaped the way I allow myself to think.

Big Magic speaks to my soul. It helps release me from a fear that I didn't even realize was holding me back. I love to _listen_ to this book. Something about the way Elizabeth Gilbert narrates it makes listening to it feel like a nice warm bath. It is soothing. I am always sad when it ends. Sometimes I start it over after just finishing it.

The Compound Effect is like medicine to me. I know that if I implemented this book 100% in my life I would be more successful. It's hard though. This is like the book that I know I need to read but I have to make myself. It has changed me and I still regularly listen to it. But each time I usually have to make myself. Make yourself read this whole book and implement at least one thing from it into your life.  

I have read/listened to these books so many times I've lost count. 

Please read them at least once.
