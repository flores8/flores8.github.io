I've seen people spend more time trying to get out of doing work than actually just doing the work.

You can do the same thing, you're free to choose after all.

You could give up on yourself. Don't try to learn. Don't care about anyone else but yourself. Rely on everyone around you to provide for you. And essentially let all the brilliance bottled up inside you go to waste.

You could do that.

Or.

You could believe in yourself. You could learn, grow, and search for opportunities to use your talents for good. Create and contribute and each time you will be learning and improving.  And never ever stop.

You could light this world. And you will find that it will light you too.

The choice is yours. But I urge you to not give up on yourself. I will never give up on you. Become the person I know you're capable of.
