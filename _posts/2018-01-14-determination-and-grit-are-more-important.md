title: "Determination and Grit are More Important than Talent"

If you want to do something but aren't good at it right now that is no indication of how good you can become.

If you don't at first seem to be the most talented writer, basketball player, violinist, web developer, or whatever, that in no way determines if you will eventually become the best in that area.

Your determination and grit are way more important than talent will ever be. If you want to be good at something set your mind to do that thing. Work at it every single day.

And you will come to see that your consistent hard work is what will make you an expert, not talent.
