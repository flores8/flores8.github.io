Each day look for at least one opportunity to do something kind for someone else.

With each interaction with someone try to find a genuine compliment that you can pay that person.

Do these things not in hopes of getting something in return but because you can.

Being kind will make you happier. It will brighten others lives. And it will make you a better person.

You could make someone's life better.

Think of that. Just by choosing to be kind. You can improve someone's life. What a powerful opportunity that lies in your hands.

So, try today to be kind.
