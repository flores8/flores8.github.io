title: "What to Tell Yourself When You Fail"

At some point in your life you will fail. If you're not failing you're not trying hard enough.

I encourage you to put yourself in situations where you may fail for these are the only situations where you will also grow. And growth is what I desire for you.

When you do fail it hurts. I know.

I've failed so many times. Right now I'm failing at something that is very important to me. I want to run my own online businesses. I want to be able to quit my job and run these successful online businesses. But I'm not there yet.

I know I will be there one day. I want to tell you why.

Here's what I tell myself and what I would tell you if you were me. I encourage you to tell yourself something similar in times of failure too:

> First, I know how it feels to try to succeed at something and to fall short. The reality is that there are others who have been in the game longer and have worked harder (and probably more consistently) than you. If you want to succeed, really succeed you must put in more effort. You must stick with it and work harder than you are right now.
>
> If you decide this goal isn't worth your time and effort and you would rather make it a hobby that is okay too.  Just know that I don't doubt for one second that if you wanted it and were willing to work for it, that you would achieve it.
