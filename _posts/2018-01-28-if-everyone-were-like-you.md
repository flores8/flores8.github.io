One of the ways I measure my choices, habits, and/or routines is by imagining that everyone in the whole world acted the same way as me.

If everyone spent at least 30 minutes every day listening or reading something uplifting, would this world be a better place?

If everyone in the world played x-box for five hours a day would this world be a better place?

If everyone in the world tried to do something kind for at least one person every day would this world be a better place?

If everyone set their three most important goals and then worked their hardest to achieve them each day would this world be a better place?

As yourself about those things you do or are thinking about doing. If everyone in the whole world did them as well. Would it make this world a better place to live? If so, you should continue doing that thing. If not, then you should stop doing that thing. And if you're not sure you should take a closer look at what you're doing and re-evaluate.

You are only one person but you can change this world for the better if you choose to. I know you can. Choose to make this world better because you're here.

One last question to think on:

What would the world look like if everyone behaved like you?
