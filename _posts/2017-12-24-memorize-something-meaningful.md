When I was a teenager I chose to memorize some passages that were meaningful to me.

One of those passages that I memorized and that I remember to this day was "The Road Not Taken" by Robert Frost.

At different times in my life I have recited them at times aloud and other times only in my head.  Those words illuminated my mind.

> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
>
> And sorry I could not travel both
>
> And be one traveler, long I stood
>
> And looked down one as far as I could
>
> To where it bent in the undergrowth;

> Then took the other, as just as fair,
>
> And having perhaps the better claim,
>
> Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
>
> Though as for that the passing there
>
> Had worn them really about the same,

> And both that morning equally lay
>
> In leaves no step had trodden black.
>
> Oh, I kept the first for another day!
>
> Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
>
> I doubted if I should ever come back.

> I shall be telling this with a sigh
>
> Somewhere ages and ages hence:
>
> Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
>
> I took the one less traveled by,
>
> And that has made all the difference.

Choose something that moves you. Something you find meaningful and memorize it. I hope it will have the same kind of impact on you as it has had on me.
