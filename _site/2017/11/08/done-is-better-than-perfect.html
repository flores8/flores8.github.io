This wasn’t something I planned to just do for a week or month and let it fizzle out after some time.</p><p>I decided this is something I would do for the rest of my life.</p><p>I started slow and set a goal last week to be able to run one mile in less than 10 minutes without stopping.</p><p>I figured this was a really easy goal to help ease me into my decision to become a runner. Keep in mind I’m really out of shape so it did require some work.</p><p>The first day I only made it .35 miles before I had to stop. By the end of the week (on Saturday) I was able to reach my goal. I made it to the one mile mark without stopping in 9:07 minutes.</p><p>There’s a lot of principles I could pull out of this experience, particularly regarding goal setting. And someday I just might. But, today I want to share with you what happened today.</p><p>I only had 15 minutes before I had to leave work to pick you up from school. I knew if I didn’t go run right then I probably wouldn’t get out for a run that day. So, I jumped up immediately and went and ran.</p><p>I ran a quick mile that I now knew I could do in less than 10 minutes with 5 minutes to cool down.</p><p>Keep in mind my new goal is to run two 10-minute miles without stopping. I knew I didn’t have time to run two miles. I made my mile in 8 minutes and was able to go even a little further with time to cool down.</p><p>I didn’t make it two miles. But I did run today and it’s better to do something imperfectly than to not do it at all.</p><p>Next time you consider not doing something because you’re worried you won’t do it perfectly, remember that it’s better to do something imperfectly than to not do it at all.</p><p>I have a feeling that I’m going to reach my two mile mark faster because I ran today than I would if I didn’t. You will get better at what you’re doing if you do it imperfectly than if you don’t do it at all.</p><p>Do your best work. But, don’t let that get in the way of shipping your work, even your imperfect work. Done is better than perfect.</p><footer><div class="links"> <a href="/about/">About</a> <a href="/contact/">Contact</a></div></footer><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', '', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview');</script></body></html>
