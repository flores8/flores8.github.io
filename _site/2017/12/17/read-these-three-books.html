It’s an impossible question for me. But I can tell you the books that have changed who I am more than any others.</p><p>These books have changed my life. They changed the way I see the world. And they have made me into a better person.</p><p>These are some of the few books that I continue to read over and over because each time I learn, improve, and become a better version of myself. Each time.</p><ul><li>Mans Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl</li><li>Big Magic by Elizabeth Gilbert</li><li>The Compound Effect by Darren Hardy</li></ul><p>Each book is so different.</p><p>Mans Search for Meaning touches me deeply and always brings a profound gratitude for the life I have. It also reminds me of the power of my mind and thoughts. It has shaped the way I allow myself to think.</p><p>Big Magic speaks to my soul. It helps release me from a fear that I didn’t even realize was holding me back. I love to <em>listen</em> to this book. Something about the way Elizabeth Gilbert narrates it makes listening to it feel like a nice warm bath. It is soothing. I am always sad when it ends. Sometimes I start it over after just finishing it.</p><p>The Compound Effect is like medicine to me. I know that if I implemented this book 100% in my life I would be more successful. It’s hard though. This is like the book that I know I need to read but I have to make myself. It has changed me and I still regularly listen to it. But each time I usually have to make myself. Make yourself read this whole book and implement at least one thing from it into your life.</p><p>I have read/listened to these books so many times I’ve lost count.</p><p>Please read them at least once.</p><footer><div class="links"> <a href="/about/">About</a> <a href="/contact/">Contact</a></div></footer><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', '', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview');</script></body></html>
